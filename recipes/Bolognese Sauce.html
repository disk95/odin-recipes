    <h4>Bolognese sauce is heavenly and boy is the texture something to write home about! With some love and patience,
        this sauce will turn out to be a work of art and TOTALLY worth the time you put into it!

        It doesn’t take much to make the very best bolognese sauce as long as you carve out a little bit of time to make
        it! It will be such a delightful surprise to your taste buds and you will be talking about how much you love it
        for days after! If you love this Italian-inspired dish, then try my alfredo, shrimp, or this gnocchi!</h4>
    <h2>What is Bolognese Sauce</h2>
    <p>If you aren’t quite sure what bolognese sauce is, I am here to tell you it is something that you MUST try!
        Bolognese sauce is a meat sauce that originated from, you guessed it, ITALY! It’s a lot different than your
        traditional spaghetti sauce that is usually tomato-based. This sauce is much creamier and thicker (because milk
        is one of the main ingredients). In addition to traditional ingredients like garlic and onion, it also has some
        carrots and celery. That sounds unusual but all of these things mixed together add up to make an absolutely
        savory, delicious flavor with a hint of sweetness!

        This sauce is fantastic over pasta but you can also make it and use it in lasagna or casseroles that call for
        some marinara sauce to switch things up! This sauce will take some time to make but it is actually very
        hands-off and super simple! My family drools over this swoon-worthy sauce and it is requested often! I love that
        the texture is thicker than a normal marinara sauce making it hearty and different. Cook this with some gnocchi
        and top with some fresh parmesan, add in some breadsticks and you will feel like you are touring Italy! You
        should definitely try this, you won’t regret it!! </p>
