    <h4>
        Need a simple, vibrant midweek meal the family will love? Put together these easy chicken fajitas and people can
        create their own masterpieces at the table
    </h4>
    <p>We can thank the cuisine of Tex-Mex for the classic fajita. Originally, the term referred to a grilled strip of
        meat served in a tortilla. These days you can find steak, chicken, shrimp, or even vegetarian fajitas. Minimal
        prep and minimal cook time means these can be on your dining room table FAST. Top them off with sour cream, pico
        de gallo, and guac and for an extra special treat go ahead and make your own flour tortillas! If you like a
        little extra spice on your fajitas go ahead and add some chili powder, cayenne, or paprika! </p>
